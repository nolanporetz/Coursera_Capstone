    "   In this project, we will be looking to help PO LLC. find the optimal borough to open up a restaurant in either Toronto or New York City.  The business problem that we would like to figure out will be: how can we use readily available data on the internet to determine where the best spot to open up such a restaurant would be?  As these cities are highly populated and diverse, it will be interesting to figure out within these two cities where there will be the least competition (or a higher need) for a restaurant.  \n",
